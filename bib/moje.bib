  abstract = {A 4\texttimes 4-matrix technique was recently introduced by Teitler and Henvis for finding propagation and reflection by stratified anisotropic media. It is more general than the 2\texttimes 2-matrix technique developed by Jones and by Abel\`es and is applicable to problems involving media of low optical symmetry. A little later, we developed a 4\texttimes 4 differential-matrix technique in order to solve the problem of reflection and transmission by cholesteric liquid crystals and other liquid crystals with continuously varying but planar ordering. Our technique is mathematically equivalent to that of Teitler and Henvis, but we used a somewhat different approach. We start with a 6\texttimes 6-matrix representation of Maxwell's equations that can include Faraday rotation and optical activity. From this, we derive expressions for 16 differential-matrix elements so that a wide variety of specific problems can be attacked without repeating a large amount of tedious algebra. The 4\texttimes 4-matrix technique is particularly well suited for solving complicated reflection and transmission problems on a computer. It also serves as an illuminating alternative way to rederive closed solutions to a number of less-complicated classical problems. Teitler and Henvis described a method of solving some of these problems, briefly in their paper. We give solutions to several such problems and add a solution to the Oseen\textendash DeVries optical model of a cholesteric liquid crystal, to illustrate the power and simplicity of the 4\texttimes 4-matrix technique.},

However, the use of Cosn (alpha) makes it easier to find analytical expressions representing texture. The Lorentzian distribution is a suitable choice for not well aligned magnets, or magnets with a high fraction of misaligned grains. It is discussed how to obtain the alignment degree Mr/Ms directly from two measurements of magnetic remanence at the transverse and parallel directions to the alignment direction of the magnet. It is demonstrated that even the well aligned magnets with Mr/Ms {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.96 present coercive field of 60\textendash 70\% of the anisotropy field, depending on the chosen distribution. The anisotropic SW model was used for discussing hysteresis squareness. Improving the crystalographical texture, the loop squareness also increases.},

In this paper, we review the Yeh's 4\texttimes 4 transfer matrix formulation in multi-layered systems and evaluate it in the limit of isotropic media to obtain a physical meaning of the singularity of the formalism. We demonstrate that the method is built on a constrained polarization vector p, which is subject to the orientation of the wavevector k. When the constraint is released in the limit of isotropic media, p vanishes, and this entails the singularity of the method.},

The discovery of magneto-optical effects evoked a new thought that the nature of light was an electromagnetic entity, and played a central role in the contribution of the development of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. Michael Faraday was at the forefront of discovering this phenomenon, as in 1845 he showed that light interacts with magnetic fields. This study primarily focuses on the understanding of the mechanism of magneto-optic effect by reviewing and critically discussing the rotation of plane of polarization of the light beam as it is transmitted through a magnetized sample, i.e., the Faraday Effect and the rotation of the plane of polarization of a light beam during reflection from a magnetized sample, namely, the Kerr Effect. Relevant theoretical characteristics of these effects and its application in modern technology are also discussed.},

The experimental procedure includes measurements with parallel and perpendicular polarized incident light and an external magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence of light. The determination of the complex Kerr amplitude and the theoretic description of the data processing in assumption of small angles of incidence and also for larger angles of incidence using adequate scaling to the mean saturation value validate this vectorial magnetometry method. In the case of an absent out-of-plane component of the magnetization vector, the complete reversal process can easily be reconstructed and interpreted by monodomain states and domain splitting.

For example, magnetic dipole moments at optical frequencies (\textmu{} = 1) become possible. This aspect substantially enriches the possibilities of optics and photonics and forms the basis for the so-called negativeindex metamaterials. Here, we describe the underlying physics and review the recent progress in this rapidly emerging field.},

  abstract = {The bistability of ordered spin states in ferromagnets provides the basis for magnetic memory functionality. The latest generation of magnetic random access memories rely on an efficient approach in which magnetic fields are replaced by electrical means for writing and reading the information in ferromagnets. This concept may eventually reduce the sensitivity of ferromagnets to magnetic field perturbations to being a weakness for data retention and the ferromagnetic stray fields to an obstacle for high-density memory integration. Here we report a room-temperature bistable antiferromagnetic (AFM) memory that produces negligible stray fields and is insensitive to strong magnetic fields. We use a resistor made of a FeRh AFM, which orders ferromagnetically roughly 100 K above room temperature, and therefore allows us to set different collective directions for the Fe moments by applied magnetic field. On cooling to room temperature, AFM order sets in with the direction of the AFM moments predetermined by the field and moment direction in the high-temperature ferromagnetic state. For electrical reading, we use an AFM analogue of the anisotropic magnetoresistance. Our microscopic theory modelling confirms that this archetypical spintronic effect, discovered more than 150 years ago in ferromagnets, is also present in AFMs. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating room-temperature spintronic memories with AFMs, which in turn expands the base of available magnetic materials for devices with properties that cannot be achieved with ferromagnets.},

The well-known integral representation of the derivative of the matrix exponential exp(tA) in the direction V, namely {$\int$}t0exp((t - {$\tau$})A)V exp({$\tau$}A) d{$\tau$}, enables us to derive a number of new properties for it, along with spectral, series, and exact representations. Many of these results extend to arbitrary analytic functions of a matrix argument, for which we have also derived a simple relation between the gradients of their entries and the directional derivatives in the elementary directions. Based on these results, we construct and optimize two new algorithms for computing the directional derivative. We have also developed a new algorithm for computing the matrix exponential that is more efficient than direct Pad\'e approximation, which is based on a rational representation of the exponential in terms of the hyperbolic function A coth(A). Finally, these results are illustrated by an application to a biologically important parameter estimation problem which arises in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.},

We conclude that intraband transitions must play a role at 1.96 eV. The second-order magneto-optic effects provide interesting insights into the magnetization reversal process, and also describe the dielectric tensor of a ferromagnetic metal. Furthermore, since the second-order magneto-optic effect is connected with the asymmetry of the magneto-optic hysteresis loop, which arises as a result of the coherent rotation of the magnetization vector, we interpret such asymmetries, which have been previously reported in the literature. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

We measure M - H loops for both orthogonal in-plane magnetization components Me (component parallel to the magnetic field) and M, (component perpendicular to the field) and for various orientations of the magnetic field with respect to the crystalline axis. These measurements show the classical four-fold cubic anisotropy for large Fe film thickness and confirm the appearance of weak uniaxial in-plane anisotropy superimposed for thinner films (t = 20 A). We have demonstrated the appearance of strong asymmetrical hysteresis loop for p-polarized incident light. We explain this behaviour as the mixing of transverse magnetization contribution to the longitudinal magnetization measurements on the basis of quadratic magneto-optical effects. The calculation of these effects based on eigenmode propagation in anisotropic layered media are developed by including the second-order magneto-optical terms in the permittivity tensor characteristic of a cubic crystal. The second-order reflection coefficients are discussed in the case of the normal incidence of the laser beam and for the magnetic field along the hard axis of the Fe film.},

Moreover, optical applications need to be seen in the context of applications of reciprocity in particle scattering, acoustics, seismology and the solution of inverse problems, generally. In some of these other fields vector wave propagation is, as it is in optics, of the essence. For this reason the simplified approach to light wave polarization developed by, and named for, Jones is explored initially to see how and to what extent it encompasses reciprocity. The characteristic matrix of a uniform dielectric layer, used in the analysis of interference filters and mirrors, is reciprocal except when the layer is magnetooptical. The way in which the reciprocal nature of a characteristic matrix can be recognized is discussed next. After this, work on the influence of more realistic attributes of a dielectric stack on reciprocity is reviewed. Some of the numerous technological applications of magnetooptic non-reciprocal media are identified and the potential of a new class of non-reciprocal components is briefly introduced. Finally, the extension of the classical reciprocity concept to systems containing components that have nonlinear optical response is briefly mentioned.},

However, the magnetic groups cannot disentangle non-relativistic phases and effects, such as the recently reported unconventional spin physics in collinear antiferromagnets from the typically weak relativistic spin-orbit coupling phenomena. Here we discover that more general spin symmetries in decoupled spin and crystal space categorize non-relativistic collinear magnetism in three phases: conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, and a third distinct phase combining zero net magnetization with an alternating spin-momentum locking in energy bands, which we dub "altermagnetic". For this third basic magnetic phase, which is omitted by the relativistic magnetic groups, we develop a spin-group theory describing six characteristic types of the altermagnetic spin-momentum locking. We demonstrate an extraordinary spin-splitting mechanism in altermagnetic bands originating from a local electric crystal field, which contrasts with the conventional magnetic or relativistic splitting by global magnetization or inversion asymmetry. Based on first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic candidates ranging from insulators and metals to a parent crystal of cuprate superconductor. Our results underpin emerging research of quantum phases and spintronics in high-temperature magnets with light elements, vanishing net magnetization, and strong spin-coherence.},

For such single-domain particles, change of magnetization can take place only by rotation of the magnetization vector. As the field changes continuously, the resolved magnetization may change discontinuously at critical values of the field. The character of the magnetization curves depends on the degree of magnetic anisotropy of the particle and on the orientation of easy axes with respect to the field. The magnetic anisotropy may arise from the shape of the particle, from magnetocrystalline effects, and from strain.

However, the high cost of the alloys has prevented their widespread applications. Emerging needs for soft magnetic materials to operate at high temperatures have caused renewed interest in FeCo alloys. The earlier studies are summarised in this review with special emphasis on phase transformations, processing, mechanical, magnetic and electrical properties of binary, ternary and more complex FeCo alloys.

  abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive study of different formalisms used to simulate polar magneto-optical (MO) effects in multilayers. A development of the 4 \texttimes{} 4 matrix calculation to first order in off-diagonal elements of the permittivity tensor gives original analytical expressions. They allow to express the MO effects in multilayers as a sum of contributions from individual layers. Each contribution consists of two components assigned to the interface and propagation effects. The explicit expressions for multilayers containing up to seven layers, together with those obtained in the frame of an ultrathin layer approximation, are shown to be useful both in a qualitative comprehension and in quantitative simulations of the experimental MO Kerr spectra of a wide variety of ultrathin magnetic structures. They can be used to separate the different contributions arising from the interfaces due to intermixing or spin polarization (including interface roughness) as well as to simulate magnetically coupled multilayers. As an example, the analytical expression is provided for a system consisting of two ultrathin films separated by a non-magnetic spacer and deposited on a non-magnetic substrate. The capabilities of the analytical expressions are demonstrated on MO spectroscopy in a broad spectral range of some well characterized ultrathin magnetic structures.},

Sci.96 (1980) 41) to magnetic crystalline media the formulas of the magneto-optic ellipsometry and the dispersion relations for wave-guiding in multilayer magnetic crystalline structures are obtained. The theory covers most of the situations considered so far in the magneto-optics in which the optical response of the structures is linear in the amplitude of the incident wave. It is capable of treating the interfaces between two magnetic media and the structures containing such interfaces with no restrictions on the orientation of the magnetizations and crystalline axes at an arbitrary angle of incidence. The polar, longitudinal and transversal magnetizations in the structures are considered as special cases. Possible applications of the theory are in the analysis of the planar multilayer magneto-optic systems in the integrated optics and magneto-optic memory technology, in the study of profiles of magnetic surfaces subjected to mechanical wear, ion implantation, etc.},
